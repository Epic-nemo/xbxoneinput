# xbxoneinput
Getting input from an xbox one controller using pygame

The code visualizes xbox one controller inputs. It is specifically mapped for use with an xbox one controller.

I couldn't find any code for input with specifically an xbox one controller and the code I found didn't work for me, so I went ahead and created some myself. 

The code is very simple and just prints the buttons you press. It can be easily changed or refrenced for many uses.

IMPORTANT: I could not reliably get joystick values so I commented out the ones that I'm pretty sure match. I will update the code in the future if I get it working reliably.

All you need is to have pygame and a xbox one controller connected to your computer (works with bluetooth and usb connections). I don't know if this will work with other controllers because it is specifically mapped for an xbox one controller.
